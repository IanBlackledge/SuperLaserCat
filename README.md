Super Laser Cat is a silly game about causing mayhem while equipped with only a laser pointer and a cat.

I originally created this game quite some time ago, but the week I spent throwing it together left the quality very... lacking. I've decided to do it justice and create an updated version using a [much better engine](https://www.unrealengine.com).

At its current stage of development, no releases are available. Additionally, I'm leaving it closed source for the time being. The original Unity version will also not be made available anytime soon.

However, I plan to document my progress using [this repo's GitHub page](https://ianblackledge.github.io/SuperLaserCat/), but development on *that* is still underway.
